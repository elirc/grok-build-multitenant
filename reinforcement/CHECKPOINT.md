# Checkpoint: Grok multitenant project

Status: **not assessed**. Passing the reference tests is author verification, not evidence that you learned the topic.

## Closed-book recall

1. What can a generic return type on a JSON request prove at runtime?
2. Why do empty, missing, malformed, and out-of-range query values need separate decisions?
3. Why can a request timeout leave the outcome of a mutation uncertain?
4. How can a review miss an untracked file, and which snapshot did your test actually use?

## Score your evidence, 0–2 per row

| Dimension | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source understanding | Cannot locate the boundary | Names a file | Traces input, transformation, and output with actual symbols |
| Model correctness | Starter or broken contract | Supplied tests pass | Own boundary test and a caught mutation too |
| Transfer | Claims app is fixed without evidence | Written change plan | Focused application check, or an explicit blocked check plus a precise reproduction plan |
| Explanation | Repeats a rule | Gives a correct example | Explains a counterexample and the model's limits |
| Ownership | Copied answer | Can explain copied code | Own prediction, spec, diff review, and revised reasoning |

Target: 8/10 and no zero in source understanding or model correctness. This is a learning checkpoint, not a production-readiness rating. A plan-only transfer remains pending even if your overall score passes.

## Three retrieval repetitions

- Tomorrow: answer the first two questions in five minutes without opening files.
- In seven days: reproduce one edge-case test from memory and explain why it matters.
- In three weeks: apply the idea to a different project in the [ten-project path](../../opusorganize/junior-reinforcement/README.md). Name one assumption that changes.

## Record

Date / commit and working-tree context / prediction / failed case / smallest fix / app check run or pending / score / next repetition date.

Explain your result in 90 seconds: user symptom → relevant boundary → evidence → change → remaining limitation. Describe only work you actually performed.
